An interactive site to track, and save notes, using express.js. This application interacts with a server to 'get', and 'post' data.

## Usage
Upon reaching the landing page, the user can input a note, when the note is complete hit the 'save' button in the top right corner of the page. You will see the note saved on the left side panel, which allows for easy retrieval.
